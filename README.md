<img src="ER_model_degrees.png" alt="" width="400">



This course introduces core concepts in network science through **coding** and **on-paper** exercises. Students will learn to analyze, model, and interpret networks.

### Topics
- Basic network analysis, paths, and components  
- Centralities (degree, betweenness, closeness)  
- Random network models (Erdős–Rényi, Watts-Strogatz, Barabási–Albert, extensions)  
- Robustness: random failures & targeted attacks  
- Modularity & community detection  
- Calculations for the friendship paradox  
- Trees and spanning trees  
- Calculations for extended Barabási–Albert models  

### Format
- **Coding:** Implement models, compute measures, visualize results (Python, NetworkX)  
- **On-paper:** Derivations, small graph problems, conceptual tasks
